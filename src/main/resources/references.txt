Java Version Output:
------------------------------
$ java -version
java version "16.0.2" 2021-07-20
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 16.0.2+7-67)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.2+7-67, mixed mode, sharing)

Note:

1.  the time Jspinners don't roll over once they reach max limit
    so to change the time from 3:45 to 4:00 requires you to
        set the minute spinner back to 0, and
        increase the hour spinner by 1

2.  I have not included a check for text edit option into the Jspinner


Extra Credit:
------------------------------
1. Added a red line that indicated the current time, and gets updated every minute.

2. Made the events display as a rectangle with rounded corners and a translucent look

3. Displayed event type tags next to the event name as small colored circles. These update as and when the user edits the event types for any event

4. Gray out event when they are being dragged to a new time.
Also show a gray event being drawn that changes whenever the user drags to create a new event, and turns into a normal blue colored event once saved

5. Events when dragged "snap" into place with the nearest 15min start time .. i.e start time automatically changes to multiples of 15min when moved aroud.
Same logic applies for new events created via dragging

6. Added a "delete event" button that only appears for existing events, which removes the event from the hashmap and hence from the calendar day view.

7. Clicks/drag before the first 00:00 line are considered as start time =  00:00, and those beyond the 00:00 line at the end of the day automatically get adjusted to an end time of 23:59
